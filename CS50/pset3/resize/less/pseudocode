TO DO: (by Zamayla)
1) open file                                       +
2) update outfile`s header info                    +
+ make correct input                               +
3) read infile`s scanline, pixel by pixel
4) resize horizontally
for each row
    for each pixel in row
        write to outfile n times
    write outfile`s padding
    skip over infile`s padding

5) remember padding!
6) resize vertically (2 variants)
"rewrite" methods
    a) remember pixels in array
    b) write array as many times as needed

for each row
    for each pixel
        write to array n times
    for n times
        write array to outfile
        write outfile padding
    skip over infile padding


or

"re-copy"methods
    a) go back to the start of the original scanline
    b) re-scale scanline

for each row
    for n-1 times
        write pixels, padding to outfile
        send infile cursor back
    write pixels, padding to outfile
    skip over infile padding



What copy.c do:
1) opens a file
2) updates header info for outfile
3) reads each scanline, pixel by pixel
4) writes each pixel into the output file`s scanline
